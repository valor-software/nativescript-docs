== What does it do

The Firebase installations service:

* Provides a unique identifier for a Firebase installation
* Provides an auth token for a Firebase installation
* Provides an API to perform GDPR-compliant deletion of a Firebase installation.

Each configured FirebaseApp has a corresponding single instance of Installations.

An instance of the class provides access to the installation info for the FirebaseApp as well as the ability to delete it.

A Firebase Installation is unique by `FirebaseApp.name` and `FirebaseApp.options.googleAppID`
