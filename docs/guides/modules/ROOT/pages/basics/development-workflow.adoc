= Development Workflow

The development workflow starts with the https://www.npmjs.com/package/nativescript[NativeScript CLI].

== CLI Basics

In this article, you're going to learn the basics of the NativeScript command-line interface, including how to create new apps, how to get those apps running on devices, and how to set up a development workflow that lets you iterate fast.

=== `create`

Open your terminal and run the following command to create a new NativeScript application:

[,bash]
----
ns create
----

The NS CLI will walk you through selecting a template using interactive prompts.

You can also use the `--template` flag with the `ns create` command to target a specific template

[,bash]
----
ns create HelloWorld --template @nativescript/template-hello-world-ts
----

Here you're passing two things to the `create` command: `HelloWorld` which determines the name of the app you are creating, and the `--template` option, which tells the NativeScript CLI to scaffold an app using a predefined template named "`@nativescript/template-hello-world-ts`" found https://github.com/NativeScript/nativescript-app-templates/tree/master/packages/template-hello-world-ts[here]

For a full list of the templates you can use, see the https://github.com/NativeScript/nativescript-app-templates/tree/master/packages[full list here]

The `create` command will take a minute to complete, as the NativeScript CLI needs to download a few dependencies while setting up your new app.

=== `clean`

This command will clean your NativeScript project.
It will delete the `node_modules`, `hooks`, and `platforms` directories from your project.
These directories sometimes need a clean slate during development of native applications.
It is similar to running "Clean Build Folder" in XCode or other IDE environments.

[,bash]
----
ns clean
----

If you're having trouble running your application, or you have added new dependencies, it's usually a good practice to start with `ns clean` before running to be sure you avoid any type of dependency issues or native project build issues.

=== `run`

Runs your project on all connected devices or in native emulators for the selected platform.
The command will prepare, build and deploy the app when necessary.
By default, listens for changes in your code, synchronizes those changes and refreshes all selected devices.

[,bash]
----
ns run android
----

Launches the app on a connected Android device or Android emulator.

[WARNING]
====
If you get an error at this point, you might not have completed the full NativeScript CLI setup.

You must have at least one AVD (Android Virtual Device) configured on your development machine for this command to run your app up on an Android emulator.
Or a connected Android device with debugging enabled.

Check the `devDependencies` of your `package.json` file.
`@nativescript/android` must be installed to avoid the "https://github.com/NativeScript/nativescript-cli/issues/4451[Unable to apply changes on a device: emulator-5554.
Error is: Invalid Version: null.]" error.
====

[,bash]
----
ns run ios
----

Launches the app on a connected iOS device or iOS simulator.

[NOTE]
====
NativeScript uses Xcode to build and run iOS apps, and Xcode is only available on macOS;
therefore, you can only run iOS apps on macOS.
There are VM and/or cloud services that allow you to build on a Mac from a PC.
====

The `run` command will take a few seconds to complete, as the CLI will be building and deploying a native Android application.
When the command finishes the native emulator will open, and launch your app on the local emulator (or connected device).

You can customize the `ns run` command using any of the following options:

* `--no-hmr` — Disables the webpack HMR option, so changes made during a session will restart the application.
* `--emulator` — Specifies that you want to debug the app in an emulator.
* `--timeout` — Sets the number of seconds that the NativeScript CLI will wait for the debugger to boot.
If not set, the default timeout is 90 seconds.
* `--clean` — If set forces rebuilding the native application.

[NOTE]
====
If you see this output in the terminal:

----
Webpack compilation complete. Watching for file changes.
Watchpack Error (watcher): Error: EMFILE: too many open files 'FILE_PATH'
Watchpack Error (watcher): Error: EMFILE: too many open files 'FILE_PATH'
Watchpack Error (watcher): Error: EMFILE: too many open files 'FILE_PATH' <-- This repeats many times
----

This is related to node configuration options on your machine.

*Solution*:

Try adding this to your `~/.bash_profile` if you have one or `~/.zshenv` if using Zsh:

----
export NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=6096"
----

Then open a new terminal window and run your app.
====

=== `debug`

The `debug` command builds and deploys a new package on a connected device or emulator.
By default, it also starts to track for changes the `app` folder, meaning that it will automatically livesync changes in code as soon as they are saved.
In order to apply the changes, the CLI will automatically restart the application after each sync.

[NOTE]
====
Changes inside `App_Resources` folder (e.g.
`AndroidManifest.xml`, `Info.plist` or any of the resources folders) trigger a rebuild after which live syncing is resumed.
====

For security reasons, the debugging agent *can't be started automatically* from the command-line.
That's why NativeScript CLI generates a URL which is printed on the screen instead.
*You need to manually copy it in Google Chrome's address bar to start debugging.*

To start the debugger for Android, run the following command:

[,bash]
----
ns debug android
----

To start the debugger for iOS, run the following command:

[,bash]
----
ns debug ios
----

You can customize the `ns debug` command using any of the following options:

* `--debug-brk` — Prepares, builds and deploys the application package on a device or in an emulator, and stops at the first JavaScript line until either the debugger frontend connects or a 30-seconds timeout elapses.
* `--start` — Attaches the debug tools to a deployed and running app.
* `--emulator` — Specifies that you want to debug the app in an emulator.
* `--timeout` — Sets the number of seconds that the NativeScript CLI will wait for the debugger to boot.
If not set, the default timeout is 90 seconds.
* `--no-watch` — If set, changes in your code will not be livesynced.
* `--clean` — If set forces rebuilding the native application.

==== iOS specific options

* `--inspector` — Flag to use the embedded Webkit Web Inspector debugger (default is Chrome DevTools).

For more information about Android debugging, run any of the following commands:

`ns help debug android` or `ns debug android --help`

For more information about iOS debugging, run any the following commands:

`ns help debug ios` or `ns debug ios --help`

=== `help`

Executing the following command in your terminal will open the CLI's documentation in your web browser.

[,bash]
----
ns help
----

== Debugging

=== Visual Studio Code

To debug NativeScript applications in https://code.visualstudio.com/[Visual Studio Code], you need the https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Telerik.nativescript[NativeScript extension for VS Code].

=== Chrome DevTools

Debugging Android and iOS applications with Chrome by executing `ns debug <android | ios>`.

////
### iOS with WebKit Web Inspector

To debug iOS applications using the WebKit Web Inspector debugger use the `--inspector` flag - `ns debug ios --inspector`.
////

=== console

One of the most natural things you can do to debug apps in any environment is writing to the system's log.
In NativeScript logging works a lot as it does on the web, as most of the same `console` APIs that work on the web also work in NativeScript.

The `console.log()` function is great for outputting primitive values such as strings, numbers, and booleans, but it doesn't work so well for objects.
For those situations you'll want to use another of the `console` object's methods intended for complex object output: `console.dir()`.

To see this in action add a `console.log()` in your app code, which uses `console.log()` to log a simple object.

[,typescript]
----
export function pageLoaded = () => {
    console.log({
      type: "Apple",
      color: "Red"
    });
};
----

If you look at your console, you'll see the following not-very-helpful output.

[,shell]
----
JS: [object Object]
----

Now replace the `console.log` reference with `console.dir`.
After the NativeScript CLI refreshes your app, you should see the full output of the object in your terminal or command prompt.

[,shell]
----
JS: === dump(): dumping members ===
JS: {
JS:     "type": "Apple",
JS:     "color": "Red"
JS: }
JS: === dump(): dumping function and properties names ===
JS: === dump(): finished ===
----

== Running on Virtual Device

=== Android Emulators

Apart from using real Android devices, a viable option is to download, install and use an Android emulator.
In NativeScript, we can use all Android emulators that are connected and recognized by the `ns device` command.

Example output from `ns device`

[,bash]
----
$ ns device
$:
Connected devices & emulators
Searching for devices...
┌───┬─────────────────────────┬──────────┬───────────────────┬──────────┬───────────┐
│ # │ Device Name             │ Platform │ Device Identifier │ Type     │ Status    │
│ 1 │ sdk_google_phone_x86_64 │ Android  │ emulator-5554     │ Emulator │ Connected │
│ 2 │ bullhead                │ Android  │ 00d3e1311075c66f  │ Device   │ Connected │
└───┴─────────────────────────┴──────────┴───────────────────┴──────────┴───────────┘
----

[TIP]
====
Sometimes emulators take longer to start.
As a recommendation and to avoid timing issues, start the emulator before executing other CLI commands.
Once the emulator is started, leave it open to avoid the initial load time the next time you need to deploy an Android application.
====

==== Creating Android Virtual Device via Android Studio

Follow the official documentation on https://developer.android.com/studio/run/managing-avds.html[Creating and Managing Virtual Devices], where the process of downloading, setting up, and using Android Emulators via Android Studio is covered.

==== Creating Android Virtual Device via command line tool

The `avdmanager` is a tool that allows you to create and manage Android Virtual Devices (AVDs) from the command line.
The `avdmanager` is provided in the Android SDK Tools package (25.3.0 and higher) and is located in `<ANDROID_HOME_PATH_HERE>/cmdline-tools/latest/bin/`.
For more information about the avdmanager and how to use it to create AVDs, see the https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/avdmanager[official avdmanager documentation].

Command syntax to create new AVD

[,bash]
----
cd $ANDROID_HOME/cmdline-tools/latest/bin
avdmanager create avd -n name -k "sdk_id" [-c {path|size}] [-f] [-p path]
----

You must provide a name for the AVD and specify the ID of the SDK package to use for the AVD using sdk_id wrapped in quotes.
For example, the following command creates an AVD named `test` using the x86 system image for API level 25:

[,bash]
----
avdmanager create avd -n test -k "system-images;android-25;google_apis;x86"
----

[WARNING]
====
The above command suggest that the system image is already downloaded.
To download an image use the `sdkmanager`.
For example `sdkmanager "system-images;android-25;google_apis;x86"`
====

The following describes the usages for the other options: -c {path|size}: The path to the SD card image for this AVD or the size of a new SD card image to create for this AVD, in KB or MB, denoted with K or M.
For example, -c path/to/sdcard/ or -c 1000M.
-f: Force creation of the AVD.
Use this option if you need to overwrite an existing AVD with a new AVD using the same name.
-p path: Path to the location where the directory for this AVD's files will be created.
If you do not specify a path, the AVD will be created in ~/.android/avd/.

To list all the downloaded system images use the `list` command.

[,bash]
----
avdmanager list
----

==== Using third-party emulators

An applicable option is to use third-party emulators (like *GenyMotion*).
Visit the official sites for details on how to install and use these emulators.

* https://www.genymotion.com[GenyMotion official site]

=== iOS Simulators

==== Creating iOS Simulators

The iOS simulator emulates iOS devices on Macs.
The following documentation is a quick way to get the iOS simulator set up.
For more information, see https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/IDEs/Conceptual/simulator_help_topics/Chapter/Chapter.html[Apple's documentation].

==== Running on iOS Simualators

On a Mac if you have XCode installed with the proper tools, executing `ns run ios` from your terminal will launch the Simulator program with a default device.
Alternatively, you can open the Simulator program on your Mac, select which device(s) you want to open by navigating to `+File -> Open Simulator+` and choosing the device to launch.
Then execute `ns run ios` and the NativeScript app will launch on the open simulator(s).

== Running on a Physical Device

=== Android Devices

'''

==== Enable Debugging over USB

Most Android devices can only install and run apps downloaded from Google Play, by default.
You will need to enable USB Debugging on your device in order to install your app during development.

To enable USB debugging on your device, you will first need to enable the "Developer options" menu by going to Settings → About phone → Software information and then tapping the Build number row at the bottom seven times.
You can then go back to Settings → Developer options to enable "USB debugging".

==== Plug in your device via USB

Let's now set up an Android device to run our NativeScript projects.
Go ahead and plug in your device via USB to your development machine.

Now check that your device is properly connecting to ADB, the Android Debug Bridge, by running adb devices.

[,bash]
----
adb devices
----

The device should be listed.
See the full https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb[adb documentation] for troubleshooting and detailed information.

==== Run your app

Type the following in your command prompt to install and launch your app on the device:

[,bash]
----
ns run android
----

=== iOS Devices

'''

==== Plug in your device via USB

Connect your iOS device to your Mac using a USB to Lightning cable.
Navigate to the `ios` folder in your project under `platforms`, then open the `.xcodeproj` file, or if you are using CocoaPods open `.xcworkspace`, within it using Xcode.

If this is your first time running an app on your iOS device, you may need to register your device for development.
Open the Product menu from Xcode's menubar, then go to Destination.
Look for and select your device from the list.
Xcode will then register your device for development.

==== Configure code signing

Register for an Apple developer account if you don't have one yet.

Select your project in the Xcode Project Navigator, then select your main target (it should share the same name as your project).
Look for the "General" tab.
Go to "Signing" and make sure your Apple developer account or team is selected under the Team dropdown.
Do the same for the tests target (it ends with Tests, and is below your main target).

==== Run your app

If the device is now registered with your developer account, you should be able to run your NativeScript app on the device.
Execute the following from your terminal to run the app from the CLI:

[,bash]
----
ns run ios
----

The app should install and launch on the connected iOS device.

Alternatively, once you have the NativeScript project built, you can open the native project inside XCode by opening the `.xcworkspace` or `.xcproject` file from XCode's menu and then running on a connected device or simulator.

== HMR

== Testing

[WARNING]
====
Be sure you have prepared/built/run the app at least once before starting the unit test runner.
====

For more information about end-to-end testing, see xref:plugins::plugins-list/detox.adoc[`@nativescript/detox` plugin].

When you develop new features inside your app, you can ensure that they are working properly and that past functionality has not regressed by writing and executing unit tests on a regular basis.
With the NativeScript CLI, you can write and execute unit tests using http://jasmine.github.io/[Jasmine], https://mochajs.org/[Mocha] with http://chaijs.com/[Chai] or https://qunitjs.com/[QUnit].

To run your unit tests, the NativeScript CLI uses http://karma-runner.github.io/latest/index.html[Karma].

=== Before You Begin

Before writing and running unit tests, verify that you have completed the following steps.

. xref:guides::basics/environment-setup.adoc[Install and configure the NativeScript CLI on your system.]
. If you don't have any projects, create a new project and navigate to the directory of the newly created directory.
+
[,bash]
----
ns create projectName
cd projectName
----

. If you want to create tests for an existing directory, navigate to the directory of the project.
+
[,bash]
----
cd existingProjectDirectory
----

[NOTE]
====
You don't need to explicitly add the platforms for which you want to test your project.
The NativeScript CLI will configure your project when you begin to run your tests.
====

=== Configure Your Project

The NativeScript CLI lets you choose between three widely popular unit testing frameworks: http://jasmine.github.io/[Jasmine], https://mochajs.org/[Mocha] with http://chaijs.com/[Chai] and https://qunitjs.com/[QUnit].
You need to configure the project for unit testing by choosing a framework.
You can use only one framework at a time.

To initialize your project for unit testing, run the following command and, when prompted, use the keyboard arrows to select the framework that you want to use.

[,bash]
----
ns test init
----

This operation applies the following changes to your project.

* It creates the `app/tests` directory.
You need to store all tests in this directory.
This directory is excluded from release builds.
* It creates an `example.js` file in the `app/tests` directory.
This sample test illustrates the basic syntax for the selected framework.
* It installs the nativescript-unit-test-runner npm module for the selected framework and its dev dependencies in `node_modules`.
* It creates `karma.conf.js` in the root of your project.
This file contains the default configuration for the Karma server for the selected framework.

[NOTE]
====
To enable and write unit tests for TypeScript or Angular project, install the TypeScript typings for the selected testing framework.
====

====

=== Write Your Tests

With the NativeScript CLI, you can extensively test *all JavaScript-related functionality*.
You can not test styling and UI which are not applied or created via JavaScript.

When creating tests for a new or existing functionality, keep in mind the following specifics.

* You need to create your tests as JavaScript files in the `app/tests` directory.
The NativeScript CLI recognizes JavaScript files stored in `app/tests` as unit tests.
* You need to write tests which comply with the testing framework specification you have chosen for the project.
* You need to export the functionality that you want to test in the code of your NativeScript project.
* You need to require the module which exposes the functionality that you want to test in the code of your unit tests.

When creating tests for a new or existing functionality, keep in mind the following limitations.

* You cannot require the file or module in which `application.start()` is called.
* You cannot use more than one testing framework per project.
* You cannot test styling and UI which are not applied or created via JavaScript.

The following samples test the initial value of the counter and the message in the Hello World template.
These tests show the specifics and limitations outlined above.

[,js]
----
var mainViewModel = require('../main-view-model') //Require the main view model to expose the functionality inside it.

describe('Hello World Sample Test:', function () {
  it('Check counter.', function () {
    expect(mainViewModel.createViewModel().counter).toEqual(42) //Check if the counter equals 42.
  })
  it('Check message.', function () {
    expect(mainViewModel.createViewModel().message).toBe('42 taps left') //Check if the message is "42 taps left".
  })
})
----

[,js]
----
// (Angular w/TypeScript)
// As our intention is to test an Angular component that contains annotations
// we need to include the reflect-metadata dependency.
import 'reflect-metadata'

// A sample Jasmine test
describe('A suite', function () {
  it('contains spec with an expectation', function () {
    expect(true).toBe(true)
  })
})
----

[,js]
----
var mainViewModel = require('../main-view-model') //Require the main view model to expose the functionality inside it.

describe('Hello World Sample Test:', function () {
  it('Counter should be 42 on start.', function () {
    assert.equal(mainViewModel.createViewModel().counter, 42) //Assert that the counter equals 42.
  })
  it('Message should be "42 taps left" on start.', function () {
    assert.equal(mainViewModel.createViewModel().message, '42 taps left') //Assert that the message is "42 taps left".
  })
})
----

[,js]
----
var mainViewModel = require('../main-view-model') //Require the main view model to expose the functionality inside it.

QUnit.test('Hello World Sample Test:', function (assert) {
  assert.equal(
    mainViewModel.createViewModel().counter,
    42,
    'Counter, 42; equal succeeds.'
  ) //Assert that the counter equals 42.
  assert.equal(
    mainViewModel.createViewModel().message,
    '42 taps left',
    'Message, 42 taps left; equal succeeds.'
  ) //Assert that the message is "42 taps left".
})
----

=== Angular TestBed Integration

To use TestBed, you have to alter your `karma.conf.js` to:

[,js]
----
    // list of files / patterns to load in the browser
    files: [
      'src/tests/setup.ts',
      'src/tests/**/*.spec.ts'
    ],
----

The file `src/tests/setup.ts` should look like this for jasmine:

[,js]
----
import 'nativescript-angular/zone-js/testing.jasmine'
import { nsTestBedInit } from 'nativescript-angular/testing'
nsTestBedInit()
----

or if using mocha:

[,js]
----
import 'nativescript-angular/zone-js/testing.mocha'
import { nsTestBedInit } from 'nativescript-angular/testing'
nsTestBedInit()
----

Then you can use it within the spec files, e.g.
`example.spec.ts`:

[,js]
----
import { Component, ElementRef, NgZone, Renderer2 } from '@angular/core';
import { ComponentFixture, async } from '@angular/core/testing';
import { StackLayout } from '@nativescript/core';
import {
    nsTestBedAfterEach,
    nsTestBedBeforeEach,
    nsTestBedRender
} from 'nativescript-angular/testing';

@Component({
    template: `
        <StackLayout><Label text="Layout"></Label></StackLayout>
    `
})
export class ZonedRenderer {
    constructor(public elementRef: ElementRef, public renderer: Renderer2) {}
}

describe('Renderer E2E', () => {
    beforeEach(nsTestBedBeforeEach([ZonedRenderer]));
    afterEach(nsTestBedAfterEach(false));
    afterAll(() => {});

    it('executes events inside NgZone when listen is called outside NgZone', async(() => {
        const eventName = 'someEvent';
        const view = new StackLayout();
        const eventArg = { eventName, object: view };
        const callback = arg => {
            expect(arg).toEqual(eventArg);
            expect(NgZone.isInAngularZone()).toBeTruthy();
        };
        nsTestBedRender(ZonedRenderer).then(
            (fixture: ComponentFixture<ZonedRenderer>) => {
                fixture.ngZone.runOutsideAngular(() => {
                    fixture.componentInstance.renderer.listen(
                        view,
                        eventName,
                        callback
                    );

                    view.notify(eventArg);
                });
            }
        );
    }));
});
----

=== Run Your Tests

After you have completed your test suite, you can run it on physical devices or in the native emulators.

==== Requirements

Before running your tests, verify that your development machine and your testing devices meet the following prerequisites.

* The Android native emulators on which you want to run your tests must be running on your development machine.
To verify that your machine recognizes the devices, run the following command.
+
[,bash]
----
ns device
----

* The physical devices on which you want to run your tests must be connected to your development machine.
To verify that your machine recognizes the devices, run the following command.
+
[,bash]
----
ns device
----

* The physical devices on which you want to run your tests must be able to resolve the IP of your development machine.
To verify that the device can access the Karma server, connect the device and the development machine to the same Wi-Fi network or establish USB or Bluetooth tethering between the device and the development machine.
* Port 9876 must be allowed on your development machine.
The Karma server uses this port to communicate with the testing device.

==== Run the Tests

To execute your test suite on any connected Android devices or running Android emulators, run the following command.

[,bash]
----
ns test android
----

To execute your test suite on connected iOS devices, run the following command.

[,bash]
----
ns test ios
----

To execute your test suite in the iOS Simulator, run the following command.

[,bash]
----
ns test ios --emulator
----

To execute your test suite in CI make sure to add `--justlaunch`.
This parameter will exit the simulator.

[,bash]
----
ns test ios --emulator --justlaunch
----

Each execution of `ns test` consists of the following steps, performed automatically.

. The CLI starts a Karma server on the development machine.
. The CLI prepares, builds and deploys your project, if not already deployed.
If already deployed, the CLI synchronizes changes to the application package.
. The CLI embeds the NativeScript unit test runner and your host network and Karma configuration in the deployed package.
. The CLI launches the main module of the NativeScript unit test runner instead of launching the main module of your app.
. The NativeScript unit test runner uses the embedded network configuration to try to connect to the Karma server on the development machine.
. When the connection between the NativeScript unit test runner and the Karma server is established, the test runner begins the execution of the unit tests.
. When the execution completes, the NativeScript unit test runner reports the results to the Karma server.
. The Karma server reports the results on the command line.

==== Re-Run Tests on Code Change

The NativeScript can continuously monitor your code for changes and when such changes occur, it can deploy those changes to your testing devices and re-run your tests.

To enable this behavior, run your `ns test` command with the `--watch` flag.
For example:

[,bash]
----
ns test android --watch
ns test ios --watch
ns test ios --emulator --watch
----

The NativeScript CLI remains active and re-runs tests on code change.
To unlock the console, press `Ctrl+C` to stop the process.

==== Configure the Karma Server

When you configure your project for unit testing, the NativeScript CLI adds `karma.conf.js` to the root of your project.
This file contains the default configuration of the Karma server, including default port and selected testing framework.
You can edit this file to customize your Karma server.

When you modify `karma.conf.js`, make sure that your changes meet the specification of the http://karma-runner.github.io/1.0/intro/configuration.html[Karma Configuration File].

=== Continuous Integration

To integrate the NativeScript unit test runner into a continuous integration process, you need to configure a Karma reporter, for example, the https://github.com/karma-runner/karma-junit-reporter[JUnit reporter].

== Using packages

=== Plugins

NativeScript plugins are npm packages with some added native functionality.
Therefore, finding, installing, and removing NativeScript plugins works a lot like working with npm packages you might use in your Node.js or front-end web development.

==== Finding plugins

The NativeScript team maintains an https://market.nativescript.org/[official marketplace], which displays a filtered list of NativeScript-related plugins from npm.
All plugins listed in the marketplace are accompanied by a metadata describing their quality.
A search for "`accelerometer`" on the plugins marketplace will point you at the plugin you need.

Alternatively, since NativeScript plugins are npm packages, you can find NativeScript plugins on https://www.npmjs.com/[npm's site] by searching for "`nativescript-plugin-name`".
For example, a search of "`nativescript accelerometer`" would point you right at the https://www.npmjs.com/package/nativescript-accelerometer[NativeScript accelerometer plugin].

If you can't find a plugin, try asking for help on https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/nativescript[Stack Overflow].
The NativeScript team and community may be able to help find what you're looking for.

// TODO: fix v7 links

Also, make sure to look through the https://docs.nativescript.org/core-concepts/modules.html[NativeScript core modules], which ship as a dependency of every NativeScript app.
There's a chance that the functionality you need is built in.
If you're still not finding what you need, you can request the plugin as an idea on the https://discourse.nativescript.org/c/plugins[NativeScript community forum], or you can take a stab at https://v7.docs.nativescript.org/plugins/building-plugins[building the plugin yourself].

==== Installing Plugins

Once you've found the plugin you need, install the plugin into your app using the `ns plugin add` command.

[,bash]
----
ns plugin add <plugin-name>
----

For example, the following command installs the xref:plugins::plugins-list/camera.adoc[NativeScript camera plugin].

[,bash]
----
ns plugin add @nativescript/camera
----

Instead of using `plugin add`, you can use your package manager as well (npm, yarn, pnpm...):

[,bash]
----
npm install --save @nativescript/camera
----

The installation of a NativeScript plugin mimics the installation of an npm package.
The NativeScript CLI downloads the plugin from npm and adds the plugin to the `node_modules` folder in the root of your project.
During this process, the NativeScript CLI adds the plugin to your project's root `package.json` file and also resolves the plugin's dependencies (if any).

==== Installing Plugins as Developer Dependencies

As shown above the command `ns plugin add @nativescript/camera` is actually doing `npm i @nativescript/camera --save` behind the scenes.
If you need to install a *developer dependency* to your project (e.g., like *@nativescript/types* or *@nativescript/webpack*) then you will need to explicitly save it as a *devDependency*.
To achieve that, use the `npm install` command with `--save-dev` flag.
For example:

[,bash]
----
npm i @nativescript/types --save-dev
----

[NOTE]
====
The difference between dependencies and developer dependencies is that *dependencies* are required to run, while *devDependencies* are needed only during development.
Example for dependency is the *@nativescript/camera* plugin which is required at runtime so you could use the hardware camera.
On the other hand, the *@nativescript/types* is a developer dependency required only for intelliSense during the development process.
The `devDependencies` should not be installed as `dependencies` to avoid large output build files (large application size).
Example `package.json` file using both `dependencies` and `devDependencies` can be found https://github.com/NativeScript/nativescript-sdk-examples-js/blob/master/package.json#L31-L44[here].
====

==== Importing and Using Plugins

Once the plugin you need is installed, you can start using it in your project.
Note that each plugin might have its configuration that needs to be satisfied so always check carefully the plugin's documentation and the README file.
The below code snippet demonstrated the basic usage of *@nativescript/camera* plugin.

[,javascript]
----
import { requestPermissions } from '@nativescript/camera'
requestPermissions()
----

[,typescript]
----
import { requestPermissions } from '@nativescript/camera'
requestPermissions()
----

==== Removing Plugins

To remove a NativeScript plugin from your project, run the following command from your command line.

[,bash]
----
ns plugin remove <plugin-name>
----

For example, the following command removes the NativeScript camera plugin.

[,bash]
----
ns plugin remove @nativescript/camera
----

As with installation, the removal of a NativeScript plugin mimics the removal of an npm package.

The NativeScript CLI removes any plugin files from your app's `node_modules` folder in the root of your project.
The CLI also removes any of the plugin's dependencies and also removes the plugin from your project's root `package.json` file.

=== Package Managers

A package manager is a piece of software that lets you manage the external code, written by you or someone else, that your project needs to work correctly.
By default, NativeScript CLI uses Node Package Manager (`npm`) for managing the dependencies of the application.
When new application is created, CLI automatically calls `npm install` to install all of its dependencies.

==== Supported package managers

NativeScript CLI allows you to configure the package manager used when working with dependencies.
When you change the defaultly used `npm` package manager, CLI will use the newly set package manager for all operations it executes related to project dependencies, for example, project creation, managing dependencies, etc.

NativeScript CLI supports three package managers:

* `npm` — this is the default option
* `yarn` — you can set it by calling `ns package-manager set yarn`.
More information about `yarn` is available https://yarnpkg.com/[here]
* `pnpm` — from version 6.4, you can use `pnpm` to manage the dependencies of your application.
You can use `pnpm` by calling `ns package-manager set pnpm`.
NOTE: You will have to use `--shamefully-hoist` flag if you call `pnpm` on your own.
CLI passes this flag when installing dependencies with `pnpm` and probably your application will not work if you omit it.
More information about `pnpm` is available https://pnpm.js.org/[here].

In case you want to check what is the currently used package manager, you can use:

[,bash]
----
ns package-manager get
----

== Updating

To upgrade a NativeScript application you need to upgrade several things: NativeScript CLI Tooling, the iOS and Android runtimes and the `@nativescript/core` module.
In the steps below, you will see how to do this.

[,bash]
----
npm install -g nativescript
----


=== Upgrading the application

You should execute the *update* command in the root folder of your project to upgrade it with the latest versions of iOS/Android runtimes and cross-platform modules.

[NOTE]
====
The *update* command is introduced in version 2.4 of NativeScript CLI.
You should update NativeScript CLI before using this command.
====

[,bash]
----
ns update
----

In order to get the latest development release instead, pass *next* as argument:

[,bash]
----
ns update next
----

You can also switch to specific version by passing it to the command:

[,bash]
----
ns update 8.0.0
----

[NOTE]
====
The command `ns update` is updating the `@nativescript/core`, `@nativescript/webpack`, and the runtimes (``@nativescript/android``and``@nativescript/ios``).
The command is combining the next three commands in this article (`ns platform add`, ``npm i --save @nativescript/core``and``npm i @nativescript/webpack --save-dev``).
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
When using the `--configs` flag, any previous configuration will be overwritten and lost.
Consider saving any custom code that you have introduced in your `webpack.config.js` and reapplying the code after using the `--configs` flag.
====

=== Upgrading platforms

Follow those steps in order to get the latest versions of Android and/or iOS runtimes.
Navigate to the root level folder where your project is, and then if you are working on an Android project, type:

[,bash]
----
ns platform remove android
ns platform add android
----

and/or (if you are working on a iOS version on a Mac):

[,bash]
----
ns platform remove ios
ns platform add ios
----

=== Upgrading @nativescript/core

The cross-platform modules are available as a npm package named https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nativescript/core[@nativescript/core].

In order to use them in your project, you will have to explicitly install the package, for example (assuming you are still in your main app project folder from the steps above):

[,bash]
----
npm install @nativescript/core@latest --save
----

This installs the *@nativescript/core* package to the node_modules folder and adds it as a dependency to the package.json of the project.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The `ns create` command will create a new project, add the *@nativescript/core* package as a dependency to its package.json and install it.
So each new project you create will have the *@nativescript/core* package installed, and you do not have to install it explicitly.
====

Another place to find *@nativescript/core* package is https://github.com/NativeScript/NativeScript/releases/[NativeScript Releases], where you can find a collection of the available @nativescript/core-*.tgz packages for every release.
You can download a selected release and install it by running: `npm install <path to @nativescript/core-*.tgz> --save`.


=== Upgrading Angular dependencies

The Angular plugin is available as an npm package named https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nativescript/angular[@nativescript/angular].
To update the version of the plugin and the related dependency, the package should be explicitly installed, and the related Angular dependencies should be updated accordingly.
To ease the update process, the plugin comes with an automated script `update-app-ng-deps` located in `<project-folder/node_modules/.bin>` folder.

[,bash]
----
npm i @nativescript/angular@latest --save
./node_modules/.bin/update-app-ng-deps
npm i
----

//TODO: What is it? ^

=== Running the Latest Code

Often when working with open-source projects, one needs functionality that has not yet passed the full release cycle, or even functionality that is not yet fully implemented.
We know that many of you are experimenters and want to try the latest and greatest features of NativeScript.
That is why we tried to make this process simple and easy to follow.
There are two ways to get the latest development code for NativeScript:

* You can get it via npm.
* You can build the source code.


=== Getting the latest development version via npm

As an open-source project NativeScript keeps not only its source code open, but its build infrastructure too.
That is why we choose https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] for our nightly builds.
Every commit in the master branch of all major NativeScript repos triggers a https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] build which publishes an npm package that can be used directly.
Follow those simple steps to get the latest development version of NativeScript:

* Uninstall any existing NativeScript versions:

[,bash]
----
npm uninstall -g nativescript
----

* Install the latest development version of NativeScript CLI:

[,bash]
----
npm install -g nativescript@next
----

* Edit the package.json file in your project and replace @nativescript/core, @nativescript/android and @nativescript/ios versions with `next`:

[,json]
----
{
  "description": "NativeScript Application",
  "dependencies": {
    "@nativescript/core": "next"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@nativescript/android": "next",
    "@nativescript/ios": "next"
  }
}
----

Instead of editing the package.json file by hand, you could run the following commands:

[,bash]
----
ns platform add ios@next
ns platform add android@next
ns plugin add @nativescript/core@next
----

* Run the `npm install` command to update the node modules:

[,bash]
----
cd <your-project-folder>
npm install
----

You are now ready to use the latest development version of NativeScript.


=== Building the source code


==== Reasoning

Building the source code is essential when one wants to contribute to an open source project.
The statement is applicable for NativeScript as well.
According to the https://github.com/NativeScript/NativeScript/blob/master/tools/notes/CONTRIBUTING.md[Contribution Guidelines], suggesting a fix involves testing the latest code.


=== Behind the curtains of running a NativeScript application

. `npm install nativescript -g`: Node Package Manager (npm) downloads and installs the https://www.npmjs.com/package/nativescript[NativeScript CLI].
. `ns create [AppName]`: The NativeScript CLI downloads the https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nativescript/template-hello-world[Hello-World template] and unpacks it to a folder named after the app name you choose.
At the same time, the CLI installs the https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nativescript/core[NativeScript cross-platform modules].
As a result, your application folder now contains an `app` folder, holding the files of your application (https://github.com/NativeScript/nativescript-app-templates/tree/master/packages/template-hello-world[source code]) and a `node_modules` folder, having the cross-platform modules (https://github.com/NativeScript/NativeScript[source code]).
. `ns platform add android/ios`: The NativeScript CLI downloads the latest SemVer-compatible version of the specified runtime, unpacks it and applies transformations to the native (Android Studio or xCode) project (e.g., changes the project name).
. `ns run android/ios`: The NativeScript CLI copies the files under the `app` folder to the `+platforms/[android/ios]/.../app+` folder following a specific logic so that these get used later by a native build tool (_gradle_/_xcode-build_).
As a next step, the NativeScript CLI executes compilation, deployment and run commands of _gradle_ or _xcode-build_.
. Any JavaScript code gets executed in a V8 or JavaScriptCore engine and embedded in the NativeScript runtimes.
Each call to an actual native object gets marshalled via the runtimes to the underlying platform and vice-versa.
The runtimes provide JavaScript handles to the native objects.


==== Contents of the NativeScript repo

The https://github.com/NativeScript/NativeScript[NativeScript framework] is built using TypeScript.
For that, one of the build steps is a TypeScript compilation, which uses TypeScript declarations of the underlying native objects.
These are really large files (https://github.com/NativeScript/NativeScript/blob/master/packages/types-android/src/lib/android-17.d.ts[android17.d.ts] and https://github.com/NativeScript/NativeScript/blob/master/packages/types-ios/src/lib/ios/ios.d.ts[ios.d.ts]).
The TypeScript compilation with these two files loaded in memory takes a lot of time.
To save development time and have as quick and stable feature output, the NativeScript team decided to keep several important applications inside the same repository so that all of them get compiled in a single pass.

Having said that, each subfolder of the https://github.com/NativeScript/NativeScript/tree/master/apps[apps] subfolder of the repo represents a single application.


==== Building the repo

When the repo gets built, it outputs a bunch of packages (stripping the version- and extension- part of the filename for clarity):

* @nativescript/core : the package, containing the core modules.
It gets distributed via https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nativescript/core[npm].
* tns-sample-* : contains some test/demo applications the team uses internally for testing.
* tns-template-* : has templates that will get used once we have the https://github.com/NativeScript/nativescript-cli/issues/374[template-selection functionality] implemented in the command-line interface.

The repo gets built via the commands:

[,bash]
----
npm install -g grunt-cli
npm install
grunt
----


==== Using the latest

To use the latest:

* Build the repo.
* Navigate to your project folder.
* Delete the `@nativescript/core` folder from the `node_modules` subfolder of your project (i.e., `rm -rf node_modules/@nativescript/core` for Linux or `rd /S /Q node_modules\@nativescript/core`).
* Install the newly built package (`npm install [PATH-TO-NATIVESCRIPT-REPO/bin/dist/nativescript-core-x.x.x.tgz]`).


==== Handling internal breaking changes

It is possible that an internal breaking change gets introduced involving an update to both the runtimes and the modules.
An internal breaking change would mean that the public API of the tns_modules does not get affected, but a work in progress change in the runtimes requires a change in the internal code of the tns_modules themselves.

When such a case happens, the https://github.com/NativeScript/ns-v8ios-runtime[ios] and https://github.com/NativeScript/android-runtime[android] runtimes must be built separately and updated via the CLI command of: `ns platform update android/ios --frameworkPath=[Path-to-Runtime-Package]`


==== Building the runtimes

As the NativeScript framework gets distributed via npm, the runtimes are also packed as npm packages.
For consistency reasons, the native builds (gradle/xcode-build) are wrapped by grunt builds that do the job.


==== Building the Android runtime

The https://github.com/NativeScript/android-runtime[android runtime] depends on the https://github.com/NativeScript/android-metadata-generator[android-metadata-generator].

Provided you have all the dependencies set, the easiest way to have the Android runtime built is to clone the two repos to a single folder so that the two are sibling folders, `cd` into the `android-runtime` folder and run:

[,bash]
----
gradle packar -PwidgetsPath=./widgets.jar
----

The resulting @nativescript/android-x.x.x.tgz package will get created in the `dist` folder.


==== Building the iOS runtime

Follow the instructions on setting up the dependencies for building the https://github.com/NativeScript/ns-v8ios-runtime[ios runtime] in the repository README and then run `grunt package`.

The build @nativescript/ios-x.x.x.tgx package will get created in the `dist` folder.

== Choosing An Editor

You can develop NativeScript apps in any text editor or IDE you prefer.


=== VS Code

Most of the NativeScript team members prefer to use https://code.visualstudio.com/[VS Code from Microsoft] as their editor for NativeScript apps.
Some reasons we use VS Code:

* Visual Studio Code has excellent support for https://www.typescriptlang.org/[TypeScript].
* Visual Studio Code gives you the ability to debug JavaScript and TypeScript code directly in your editor.
The NativeScript team maintains an official https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=NativeScript.nativescript[NativeScript Visual Studio Code extension] that enables step debugging for NativeScript apps.
* Visual Studio Code is a fast, modern editor that Microsoft https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/[updates frequently].
* Visual Studio Code is available for Windows, macOS, and Linux.
* Microsoft backs Visual Studio Code;
therefore, you can feel confident that the editor will continue to be supported in the future.

If you do choose to https://code.visualstudio.com/[try Visual Studio Code], let's look at one tip you might find useful as you develop NativeScript apps.

* The `code` command

After you install Visual Studio Code, you can open projects using the editor's `File` → `Open` menu option, but there's an alternative option that works far better for command-line-based projects like NativeScript: the `code` command.

The `code` command runs in your command-line or terminal, and it works just like the `ns` command does for NativeScript apps.
Visual Studio Code installs the `code` command by default on Windows on Linux, but on macOS, there's https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac[one manual step] you must perform.

Once set up, you can type `code .` in your terminal to open the files in your current folder for editing.
For example, you could use the following sequence of command to create a new NativeScript app and open it for editing.

[,bash]
----
ns create MyNewApp
cd MyNewApp
code .
----

=== WebStorm

If you're a WebStorm user, check out this https://plugins.jetbrains.com/webstorm/plugin/8588-nativescript[popular community-written plugin] that adds many NativeScript-related features.
