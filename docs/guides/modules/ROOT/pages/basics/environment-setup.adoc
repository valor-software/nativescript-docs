== Setting up your system

This page will walk through installing everything you need to build your first NativeScript app.

=== Windows + Android

You will need Node, NativeScript CLI (command line interface), Android Studio and a JDK (java development kit).

*Android Studio* is not strictly necessary &mdash;
however it provides an easy-to-use interface for installing and managing the Android SDKs.

We recommend using https://chocolatey.org/[Chocolatey] to install the required dependencies &mdash;
a popular package manager for Windows.

To install *Node* and *JDK* (using the prebuilt OpenJDK binaries from https://adoptium.net/[Adoptium]) open an Administrator Command Prompt (right click and select "Run as Administrator") and run the following command:

[source%linenums,cli]
----
choco install -y nodejs.install temurin11
----

Setting up the Android development environment can be daunting if you are new to Android development, however following the next steps carefully will get you up and running in no time.

https://developer.android.com/studio[Download and install Android Studio].
In the installation wizard make sure to have the following components selected, (the list should appear if you select *custom* options):

* Android SDK
* Android SDK Platform
* Android Virtual Device
* Performance (Intel ® HAXM) &mdash;
optional, learn more about https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2018/07/android-emulator-amd-processor-hyper-v.html[AMD Processor & Hyper-V support]

The setup may take a while, but once it has finished a welcome screen should appear.

Android Studio installs the latest Android SDK by default, which in most cases should be all that's needed to build a NativeScript app.

Configure the `ANDROID_HOME` environment variable for NativeScript to be able to find the Android SDK.

. Search for "*Edit the system environment variables*" in Windows Search and select
. Click on "*Environment variables...*" in the bottom corner
. Under the "*User variables for...*" click on *New...* to create the `ANDROID_HOME` user variable that points to the path of the Android SDK:

image::guides::environment-setup/new_user_variable_dialog.png[New User Variable (ANDROID_HOME)]

The SDK is by default located at

----
%LOCALAPPDATA%\Android\Sdk
----

To find the actual location in the Android Studio *Settings*, navigate to *Appearance & Behavior › System Settings › Android SDK* and copy the Android SDK Location.

Add Android *platform-tools* to a path.

. Search for "*Edit the system environment variables*" in Windows Search and select
. Click on "*Environment variables...*" in the bottom corner
. Under the "*User variables for...*" select the *Path* variable and click *Edit...*
. Click *New* and add the *platform-tools* path to the list.

The default location is inside the Android SDK's `platform-tools` folder:

----
%LOCALAPPDATA%\Android\Sdk\platform-tools
----

Install the NativeScript CLI globally:

[source%linenums,cli]
----
npm install -g nativescript
----

To verify if the installation was successful, open a new Command Prompt window to ensure the new environment variables are loaded and run

[source%linenums,cli]
----
ns doctor android
----

If you see *No issues were detected,* you have successfully set up your system.

==== Preparing an Android device

To run a NativeScript app, you will need an Android device &mdash;
either a physical or a virtual device.

* *Using a physical device*: Connect the device using a USB cable, and follow the instructions from xref::basics/development-workflow.adoc[Running on a physical device]
* *Using a virtual device*: Open Android Studio, and open "AVD Manager" &mdash;
If you are on the welcome screen, it's under the *Configure › AVD Manager* dropdown, otherwise under the *Tools › AVD Manager* menu.
+
If the list of available Virtual Devices is empty, you will need to create a new AVD.
Click on "*Create a Virtual Device...*" then pick a phone from the list.
You can select any phone from the list &mdash;
for example "*Pixel 3 XL*" and then click "*Next*".
For the System Image select the latest version (the highest API Level in the list).
If the selection is greyed out, click the "Download" link next to the Release Name to download the System Image and then click "*Next*" and "*Finish*" creating the AVD.
The newly created AVD should show up in the list, and you should be able to click the green "play" button to start the virtual device.

=== Windows + iOS

:::warning Unsupported A Mac is required to build projects that use native iOS code.
Simpler apps can be tested using the NativeScript Playground.
:::

=== macOS + Android

You will need Node, NativeScript CLI (command line interface), Android Studio and a JDK (java development kit).

*Android Studio* is not strictly necessary &mdash;
however it provides an easy-to-use interface for installing and managing the Android SDKs.

We recommend using https://brew.sh/[Homebrew] to install the required dependencies &mdash;
a popular package manager for macOS.

:::warning When installing Homebrew, carefully follow their instructions to avoid configuration issues.
:::

Once you have Homebrew installed, to install *Node* open a Terminal and run the following command:

[source%linenums,cli]
----
brew install node
----

:::tip Pro tip!
If you need to work with multiple versions of node, you may skip installing node via Homebrew, and use a node version manager: https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm[nvm], https://npmjs.com/n[n] or any other node version manager you prefer.
:::

To install a *JDK* (using the prebuilt OpenJDK binaries from https://adoptium.net/[Adoptium]) run the following command:

[source%linenums,cli]
----
brew tap homebrew/cask-versions
brew install --cask temurin11
----

:::warning Note The default `temurin` does not currently work with the gradle plugin version NativeScript uses, so we recommend sticking with an older version for now.

Android Studio installs the latest Android SDK by default, which in most cases should be all that's needed to build a NativeScript app.

Configure the `ANDROID_HOME` environment variable for NativeScript to be able to find the Android SDK, and add the required tools to path.

Add the following lines to your shell profile, usually `~/.bash_profile` or `~/.bashrc`, or if you are using `zsh` then `~/.zprofile` or `~/.zshrc` config file:

[source%linenums,shell]
----
export ANDROID_HOME=$HOME/Library/Android/sdk
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools
----

Install the *NativeScript CLI* globally:

[source%linenums,cli]
----
npm install -g nativescript
----

To verify if the installation was successful, open a new Command Prompt window to ensure the new environment variables are loaded and run

[source%linenums,cli]
----
ns doctor android
----

If you see *No issues were detected,* you have successfully set up your system.

=== macOS + iOS

You will need Node, NativeScript CLI (command line interface), XCode, xcodeproj, cocoapods.

We recommend using https://brew.sh/[Homebrew] to install the required dependencies &mdash;
a popular package manager for macOS.

:::warning Note When installing Homebrew, carefully follow their instructions to avoid configuration issues.
:::

Once you have Homebrew installed, to install *Node* open a Terminal and run the following command:

[source%linenums,cli]
----
brew install node
----

:::tip Pro tip!
If you need to work with multiple versions of node, you may skip installing node via Homebrew, and use a node version manager: https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm[nvm], https://npmjs.com/n[n] or any other node version manager you prefer.
:::

Next you will need *XCode*.
XCode will install on macOS 10.15.7 Catalina or later.
It will need about 50G Disk space for installation.
Open the *AppStore*, search for *XCode* and and install it.

Once the installation is complete (this may take a while &mdash;
brew a coffee and enjoy a little break), open *XCode* and if it prompts you to install the Command-Line-Tools make sure to say *Yes*.

Open `XCode › Preferences › Locations` and make sure *Command Line Tools* is set

image::guides::environment-setup/xcode_command_line_tools.png[XCode Preferences, Locations]

Install *ruby 2.7* and link it so it's available in your shell environment:

[source%linenums,cli]
----
brew install ruby@2.7
brew link ruby@2.7
----

Add the following lines to your shell profile, usually `~/.bash_profile` or `~/.bashrc`, or if you are using `zsh` then `~/.zshrc` config file:

[source%linenums,shell]
----
# Add rubygems to the path
export PATH=/opt/homebrew/lib/ruby/gems/2.7.0/bin:$PATH
# or
export PATH=/usr/local/lib/ruby/gems/2.7.0/bin:$PATH
----

:::warning Important Make sure to open a new terminal window for the changes to take effect!
:::

In a new terminal window, install the *+++<abbr title="A package manager for managing 3rd party native dependencies">+++cocoapods+++</abbr>+++* and *+++<abbr title="CLI utility to interact with XCode projects">+++xcodeproj+++</abbr>+++* gems by running the following commands:

// Note: xcodeproj seems to be installed when installing cocoapods via brew

// brew install cocoapods # this will install both cocoapods and xcodeproj

// gem install ... # requires root privileges on macOS. sudo works.

[source%linenums,cli]
----
sudo gem install cocoapods
sudo gem install xcodeproj
----

Depending on installation methods, the location of ruby gems may vary.
Make sure you have the right folder in your `$PATH` by running `which pod`.
If the binary is not found run `gem env` to examine your folders, and update your `$PATH` in the login profile file.

:::warning Important note about macOS 12.3+

Starting with macOS 12.3, python 2.x is no longer shipped with the system and the python3 executable isn't aliased to `python`, you will need to do that manually.

If you are on macOS 12.3 or newer, please follow these instructions.

[WARNING]
====
*Note*: Python 3 is fully supported by the NativeScript components that rely on it, however changing our scripts to use the `python3` executable name by default is a minor breaking change we're aiming to introduce in NativeScript 8.3.
Until then, this workaround is required to get running.

[source%linenums,cli]
----
# link and alias the installed python3
# version to be available to XCode as python
sudo ln -s $(which python3) /usr/local/bin/python
----

Next, update *+++<abbr title="Python package manager">+++pip+++</abbr>+++* and install *+++<abbr title="Python 2 & 3 compatibility package used by NativeScript">+++six+++</abbr>+++* by running the following:

[source%linenums,cli]
----
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
python3 -m pip install six
----

Now continue to the "Install the *NativeScript CLI* globally" section below.
====

If you are not on macOS 12.3+, install *+++<abbr title="Python package manager">+++pip+++</abbr>+++* and *+++<abbr title="Python 2 & 3 compatibility package used by NativeScript">+++six+++</abbr>+++* by running the following:

[,cli]
----
sudo easy_install pip==20.3.3
python -m pip install six
----

[NOTE]
====
You may see a Deprecation warning when installing *six*, feel free to ignore it for now &mdash;
NativeScript will update to Python 3.x in version 8.3.
====

Install the *NativeScript CLI* globally:

[,cli]
----
npm install -g nativescript
----

[NOTE]
====
You may see Deprecation and security warnings from *npm*, these are safe to ignore.

*More details for those curious:* The NativeScript CLI relies on 3rd party packages that may have been deprecated over the past years.
We are slowly replacing these dependencies with newer, supported alternatives to resolve these warnings, however, they are generally safe to ignore, since the CLI is never exposed to the public, and it's only used for local development, where most of the security concerns don't apply._
====

To verify if the installation was successful, open a new Terminal window to ensure the new environment variables are loaded and run

[,cli]
----
ns doctor ios
----

If you see *No issues were detected,* you have successfully set up your system.

////
If you see the following, you have successfully set up your system for iOS development. Select **Skip Step and Configure Manually** or hit `Ctrl+C` to exit.

![ns doctor output](assets/environment-setup/ns_doctor_ios.png)

==== iOS watchOS Applications

With version 5.4, the NativeScript CLI introduces Beta support for integrating a https://developer.apple.com/watchos/[watchOS] application in your iOS mobile app created with NativeScript.

==== Prerequisites

* *NativeScript CLI version 5.4* and above.
* NativeScript project.
* *Xcode 10* and above.
* Paired devices or simulators (*iPhone* and *iWatch* with *watchOS 4.x/5.x* and above).
+
[NOTE]
====
watchOS 4.x won't work with the default Watch App created with Xcode.
The user will have to manually set *_`WATCHOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET`_* in the configuration json (see below for details).
====
+
* WatchOS app created with *Objective-C* (Swift code https://github.com/NativeScript/nativescript-cli/issues/4541#issuecomment-491202270[is *not* supported yet]).

==== WatchOS application in NativeScript.

To integrate your existing watchOS application into your NativeScript project, execute the following steps:

. Create a *_Single View App_* from Xcode.
. Add watch app target through menu:_File[New > Target > WatchKit App_].
. Add a name to your watch app, for example, *_MyFirstWatchApp_*.
On the same screen, verify that *Objective-C* is selected as your language.
+
[NOTE]
====
You can skip steps 1-3 if your Watch app is already created.
====
+
. Copy the generated *_MyFirstWatchApp_* and *_MyFirstWatchAppExtension_* to *_.../apps/MyApp/app/App_Resources/iOS/watchapp/MyFirstWatchApp_* and *_.../apps/MyApp/app/App_Resources/iOS/watchextension/MyFirstWatchAppExtension_* respectively.
. Inside the *_Info.plist_* of the Watch App replace the value of *_`WKCompanionAppBundleIdentifier`_* with *_`$(WK_APP_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER)`_*.
. Inside the *_Info.plist_* of the Watch Extension replaces the *_`WKAppBundleIdentifier`_* with *_`$(WK_APP_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER)`_*.
. You can populate the *_Assets.xcassets_* of the Watch App and add the name of the *_`appiconset`_* to the *_.../apps/MyApp/app/App_Resources/iOS/watchapp/MyFirstWatchApp/watchapp.json_*:
+
[,JSON]
----
{
    "assetcatalogCompilerAppiconName": "AppIcon"
}
----

. You can modify *_`WATCHOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET`_* of the Watch App by adding the value inside the *_watchapp.json _* file like this:
+
[,JSON]
----
{
    "assetcatalogCompilerAppiconName": "AppIcon",
    "targetBuildConfigurationProperties": {
        "WATCHOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET": 4.1
    }
}
----

. Build & Run the NativeScript application.
+
[,cli]
----
ns run ios
----

. The application will be deployed and started on your iOS device/simulator.
Make sure that the test iPhone is already paired with the testing iWatch.
Once the iOS app starts, the Watch app will be automatically deployed on the testing iWatch device.
